    <h1>NEVER WALK ALONE</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was an hunter called Ogundeji. He was a very strong hunter among the other hunters in the villiage and he had every wepons to fight and kill any animal that comes accross him while hunting.
        One day, he went for hunting in a big forest and he was alone as usual without fearing any animal, no matter the type of animals.
        After hunting for some hours, he got to a place and found himself in the garden of lions more than five and he did not know what to do ?
        He was thinking of how he was going to escape in the mist of hungry lions and the same time, to kill one among the lions so as to proof himself as a strong and powerful hunter.

        The hungry lions have already surrounded him to eat him-up,while he was thinking of what to do !
        <p>unknowinly, two hunters appear to resque the great hunter surrounded by hungry lions and fortunately they manage to kill one of the lion, while others ran away.</p>
        <p>Ogundeji was so happy because he might not suvive the battle with the hungry lions and his life will end.
            He then concluded in his mind that no matter how powerful you may be in life, NEVER WALK ALONE...
